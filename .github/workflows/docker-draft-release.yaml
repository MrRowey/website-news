# The main purpose of the custom image in this repository is to reduce the time
# that it takes to start developing. This is not just about the tool chain, it is
# also about related packages and gems. We need to keep the image up to date.

# With this workflow we automate the suggestion to create a new release whenever
# there are changes in the dependencies of the project.
